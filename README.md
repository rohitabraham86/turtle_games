Turtle Games, a game manufacturer and retailer with a global customer base wants to improve overall sales performance.

Turtle Games wants to understand: 

- how customers accumulate loyalty points
- how groups within the customer base can be used to target specific market segments 
- how social data (e.g. customer reviews) can be used to inform marketing campaigns
- the impact that each product has on sales
- how reliable the data is (e.g. normal distribution, skewness, or kurtosis)
- what the relationship(s) is/are (if any) between North American, European, and global sales?
